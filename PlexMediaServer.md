<h1>Plex Media Server Setup</h1>

Just set up the Raspberry Pi as you normally would. Remember to configure a static IP address.

Then just follow the installation guide on the [official documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/) it's just a One-Step automated install.

To change the default password do `pihole -a -p`.

To access the Pi-Hole dashboard just go into the static ip address/admin
